> [!WARNING]  
> **Storybook & React Router Plugin Issue**  
>  
> During development, I encountered an issue where **Storybook would fail to build** if the `reactRouter()` plugin was used instead of the basic `react()` plugin.  
>  
> Due to time constraints, I implemented a **temporary workaround** rather than a full fix.
>  
> This approach allows Storybook to work, but it‚Äôs a **band-aid solution**. a more robust fix is still needed.

## ‚è± Time Spent & Tradeoffs

I dedicated a little over **3 hours** to this project.  

- Spent a couple of hours **creating and styling components** using **TailwindCSS** and **PrimeReact**.  
- Implemented **routing** between pages, along with **simple loading and error handling**.  
- Encountered a **storybook build issue** (related to the `reactRouter()` plugin), which consumed a significant portion of development time.  
- Due to this, I was **unable to make some pages/components fully responsive**.  
- Implemented a **simple landing page**. prioritizing functionality over extraordinary design, focusing on delivering a **working and maintainable application**.
